# smrt - Yet another raspberry pi "smart-mirror".

### TLDR What is this?
At the moment all I'm doing is configuring a RaspberryPi Zero W to run X and display a webkit view which pulls up this repo's public page located here:

### Why would you do this?
A little while back one of my development LCDs died.  After a little fiddling I discovered that it was only PARTIALLY broken.
The display still works fine for CEA devices (think consumer television applications), but does not work with DMT standard devices. (think computer screens)

As a nerd with a raspberry pi I knew what must be done, and this project was born.

### // TODO
- [x] figure out how to run X on boot and display webkit view
- [x] create proof of concept slideshow which pulls interesting imgages
- [ ] build widget which pulls iCal/Google Cal agenda
- [ ] build Date/Time widget
- [ ] build Weather widget
- [ ] design smart mirror frame/mount for dispay
- [ ] design raspberry pi zero w + camera case which works with smart mirror design


#### CEA / DMT What's that?
CEA:
Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA-861B) refers to a CEA/EIA standard which consists of display timing and formats supported by Digital Televisions

DMT:
Display Monitor Timings (DMT) are a list of VESA standard pre-defined timings which are commonly used within the Computer industry.
